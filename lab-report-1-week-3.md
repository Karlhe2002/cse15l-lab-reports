# Lab-report week 3

##
- Make a fork on the github repository, which makes a copy of your repository
- Open it in VScode.
- Get two files-"Server.java" "NumberServer.java".
- The "NumberServer.java" mainly serves for a simple number editor. It can add the number by specific URL input as a command.
- Compile and run it. (We have learned that before.)
- Get a website link. Copy it into your browser.
- Use the "scp" command to copy these two files to the remote computer.
- Compile and run on remote computer.

- Creat the "SearchEngine.java" file, which can add the new string to the list, also can search the word being added. (like a dictionary)
